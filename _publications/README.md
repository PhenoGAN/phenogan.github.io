# Publications

This is a placeholder folder to which you can add publications to be posted on the group website. Note that nothing that is entered in this file will be tracked by git, but rather will be posted to  `rpdata.caltech.edu/publications`. Any files added to this folder can be added when running the `transfer_files.sh` shell script.
