<p><img style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%;" src="/forty-jekyll-theme//assets/images/allostery.png" /></p>

<p>One of the most far reaching phenomena for the molecules of the cell is
allostery, the fact that these molecules can exist in distinct conformations
with different activities.  Examples range from ion channels to transcription
factors to enzymes.  We have been very interested in the unity of perspective
offered by the famed Monod-Wyman-Changeux model for allosteric molecules and
have been using this framework to guide a variety of experiments on allosteric
transcription factors with the objective of learning how phenotypic properties
such as the leakiness and the effective cooperativity are determined by the
underlying microscopic parameters characterizing these molecules.  In addition,
these ideas have led us to an evolutionary perspective in which we aim to
understand how mutations lead to phenotypic changes in the functional behavior
of allosteric molecules.</p>

<h2 id="its-a-phage-world">It’s a Phage World</h2>

<p><img style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%;" src="/forty-jekyll-theme//assets/images/phage_world.png" /></p>

<p>Studies of viral diversity suggest there are in excess of 10<sup>30</sup> viruses on
planet Earth, dwarfing the numbers of any other kinds of biological organisms.
Our group has a long standing interest both in the physics of how viruses work
and in their function and diversity in the world around us.  Our studies of the
physics of viruses have focused on how viruses package and deliver their
genomes, using both theoretical ideas from elasticity and statistical mechanics
as well as single-molecule and single-cell experimental techniques.  Our goal
is to delineate the physical processes of viral infections and their stunningly
precise process of viral assembly.  We have also been investigating the
challenging but important question of what viruses are present in natural
environments such as the termite gut and the human mouth, what hosts they
effect and what their ecological role in these natural environments.</p>

<h2 id="deciphering-the-genomic-rosetta-stone">Deciphering the Genomic Rosetta Stone</h2>

<p><img style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%;" src="/forty-jekyll-theme//assets/images/rosetta_stone.png" /></p>

<p>Most people surveyed would say that E. coli is probably biology’s best
understood organism.  And yet, out of its more than 4500 different genes, we
know nothing about how half of those genes are regulated.  Literally nothing –
no transcription factor binding sites, no transcription factors identified that
regulate those genes.  Work in our laboratory is using a combination of
mutagenesis, cell-sorting, and deep sequencing,   mass spectrometry and models
from information theory and statistical physics to uncover the regulatory
architectures of some of these uncharacterized genes.  Once we have these
regulatory architectures in hand, we then turn to allied efforts in the
laboratory aimed at using statistical mechanical models of gene regulation in
conjunction with precision measurements to predict and measure the full
input-output behavior of these genes.  Further, we are also engaged in using
these approaches in the evolutionary setting to explore how transcription
factors and their binding sites co-evolve.</p>

<h2 id="action-at-a-distance-on-genomes">Action At A Distance On Genomes</h2>

<p><img style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%;" src="/forty-jekyll-theme//assets/images/at_a_distance.png" /></p>

<p>In prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike, many genomic processes require distant
parts of the genome to come into contact.  For example, in prokaryotic gene
regulation, DNA looping is a common motif whereby transcription factors bind at
more than one site simultaneously looping the intervening DNA.  Similarly, in
the context of the immune system, the process of V(D)J recombination requires
different gene segments to be joined together in order to create the DNA
templates that lead to antibodies.  Work in our laboratory aims to bring
together theoretical ideas from statistical physics with single-molecule and
single-cell approaches to trying to understand the mechanism of such action at
a distance.</p>

<h2 id="specificity-costs">Specificity Costs</h2>

<p><img style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%;" src="/forty-jekyll-theme//assets/images/vdj.png" /></p>

<p>“Napoleon is in equilibrium”.  These words were fired off at a speaker who had
used ideas from equilibrium statistical mechanics to evaluate some process in
molecular biophysics.  Though equilibrium ideas certainly work in many contexts
that at first blush seem inappropriate, indeed, there are many biological
processes which are highly dependent upon the fact that the system is out of
equilibrium.  Work in our group in this area aims to explore how processes such
as DNA replication have such amazingly high fidelity in comparison with what is
permitted by thermodynamic equilibrium alone.  A second exciting set of
questions center on how energy invested in biological processes permits
reactions to occur in a sequential fashion that is forbidden by equilibrium
considerations.</p>
