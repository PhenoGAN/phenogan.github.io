Welcome to the Rob Phillips Physical Biology Laboratory! Research in our
group focuses on the development of quantitative, theoretical models to
describe a broad range of biological phenomena. We then use these models to
guide our experimental efforts, where we perform precision measurements to
explore the validity of our predictions. Our group has graduate students
from across campus including <a href="http://www.bbe.caltech.edu">Biology and
Bioengineering</a>, <a href="http://www.cce.caltech.edu/content/biochemistry-and-molecular-biophysics">Biochemistry and Molecular
Biophysics</a>, <a href="http://www.aphms.caltech.edu">
Applied Physics</a>, and
<a href="http://www.pma.caltech.edu/content/physics">Physics</a>. Some of our current
principal research threads focus on broad questions of how genomes are
organized both in sequence and spatially to regulate the expression of
their genes, how the flow of energy through biological systems gives rise
to their impressive fidelity, and questions on the diversity and ecological
role of viruses in their natural environments.
