Recent Innovations in Precision Agriculture (PA) are driven by Computer Vision and Data Processing systems to quantify plant parameters. Quantitative analysis of Plant Phenotyping in PA and monitoring morphological traits is a protracting process, precluding the objective and phenotyping pipeline. Computer
Vision and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)â€™s offer a catalytic approach to the time-consuming
process, providing a solution to the phenotyping bottleneck. This research proposes a concept of curating
data of plant growth over time to predict conditional growth and responsive stimuli of the plant under
different situations and how this can affect crop yield. The method proposed here is a non-invasive approach to the existing destructive biomass estimation methods and Frameworks. This methodology of the
research focuses on utilizing image parameters modelled using a time series Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Networks PGGAN to map plant growth patterns and progressive variance in biomass of
plant in the Spatio-Temporal Domain. These Generative networks evaluate and predict based on merely
raw pixel input excluding dependence on further constraints, feature vectors or parameters influencing
data.
